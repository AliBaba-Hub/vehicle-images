Vehicle Images for [okokScripts](https://okok.tebex.io/)

**Up to date DLC:** The Chop Shop 1.68

Instructions on how to add vehicles: [okokVehicleShop](https://docs.okokscripts.io/scripts/okokvehicleshop#adding-vehicle-images) - [okokGarage](https://docs.okokscripts.io/scripts/okokgarage#adding-vehicle-images)
- **vehicles-all:** Has all the gta vehicles images
- **vehicles-rp:** Has what I think is more suitable for and RP server

Any feedback is welcome, I did my best on removing the background of each vehicle!
