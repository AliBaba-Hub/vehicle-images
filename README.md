Vehicle Images for [okokScripts](https://okok.tebex.io/)

Just download the [last release](https://github.com/SrPeterr/okokvehicle-images/releases) go to `okokVehicleShop/web/img` and drag the images from the folder you want
- **vehicles-all:** Has all the gta vehicles images
- **vehicles-rp:** Has what I think is more suitable for and RP server

Any feedback is welcome, I did my best on removing the background of each vehicle!
